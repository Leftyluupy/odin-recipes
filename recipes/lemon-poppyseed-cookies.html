    <a href="../index.html">Main Page</a>
    <h2>Ingredients List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>200g white sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>Zest of 2 lemons</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tsp of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2.5 tsp of poppy seeds</li>
        <li>290g flour</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>0.25 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Equipment List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Stand Mixer (highly recommended) or very large bowl and mixing spoon</li>
        <li>Baking Sheets</li>
        <li>Parchment/Baking Paper</li>
        <li>Spoon or something else to scoop cookie dough</li>
        <li>Cooling rack</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Procedure:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cream the butter and sugar. If using a stand mixer, simply mix using the standard paddle. If mixing by hand,
            beat the butter and sugar together with the spoon. In either case, the sugar granules should dissolve in the butter, 
            and the butter should change color to very pale yellow. The mixture should be very fluffy in appearance. Don't be 
            surprised if this takes a while, especially if mixing by hand. It is possible but not likely to overmix; the bigger 
            issue would be to rush this step. So don't stop mixing until it is pale yellow and fluffy!
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the wet ingredients: the egg, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Add the poppy seeds too. Mix these 
            together until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            At this point, it is safe to preheat the oven to 350F. Prepare your baking sheets with parchment paper (or grease with butter).
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the dry ingredients: the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Many recipes say to mix them together in 
            a separate bowl, but I always put the flour on top of the wet ingredients, add the smaller amounts of dry ingredients, and 
            gently whisk them through the pile of flour before mixing into the wet ingredients. It saves one dish from getting dirty, 
            which is important if you are lazy. Anyway, once you mix the dry ingredients thoroughly into the wet, your cookie dough is ready.
        </li>
        <li>
            Scoop cookie dough in 1.5 tbsp size scoops onto baking sheets. Give about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between each scoop of dough.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake at 350F for 10 minutes. Cool on the tray for 5 minutes, then remove to a cooling rack.
        </li>
    </ol>

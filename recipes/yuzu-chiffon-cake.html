    <h1>Yuzu Chiffon Cake</h1>
    <a href="../index.html">Main Page</a>
    <p>My own original recipe, adapted from other citrus chiffon cake 
        recipes I have read over the years.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients List:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>225g sifted cake flour</li>
        <li>250g + 50g white sugar, separated</li>
        <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>5 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>177ml yuzu juice</li>
        <li>118ml oil (vegetable recommended, but use whatever you have)</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp yuzu zest</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>8 large egg whites</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp cream of tartar (highly recommended)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Equipment List:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Stand mixer with whisk and one additional large bowl OR two large bowls and a whisk</li>
        <li>Spatula or large flat spoon</li>
        <li>Cake pan for chiffon cake (highly recommended)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Procedure:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix the dry ingredients: In the large bowl (not the mixer bowl), combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and only 250g of the sugar. 
            Save the other 50g of sugar for later.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the wet ingredients: Mix the 5 egg yolks, yuzu juice, oil, vanilla extract, and yuzu zest into the large bowl 
            of dry ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk egg whites: In your stand mixer with the whisk or in a separate bowl, put the 8 egg whites and the cream of tartar. Whisk until soft peaks start 
            to form. Continue whisking while gradually adding the remaining 50g of sugar. When the egg whites start to look less glossy, stop whisking.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take a moment to preheat the oven to 160C.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine egg whites into rest of batter: Using a large mixing spoon or spatula, put about 25% of the whites into the large bowl of cake batter. Gently fold/flip over 
            the batter and egg whites until it looks mostly evenly distributed. Add the remaining egg whites and fold again until just uniform in color. Don't 
            overfold or you will lose all the air you whisked into the egg whites and the cake won't be as fluffy and you will be sad.
        </li>
        <li>
            Carefully get all your cake batter into your <strong>ungreased</strong> cake pan. Even out the top a bit if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you used a 8-10 inch tube/donut pan, bake that sucker for 55-65 minutes. If you used a 9x13 inch sheet pan, bake for 30-35 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Once a cake tester comes out clean, remove from oven and cool the cake in the pan. Cool your cake upside down: if using a chiffon cake pan, 
            it should have special feet, so you can easily flip it over to cool and keep air flowing under the cake. If you used a sheet pan, you will need 
            to find something to hold the pan up away from the counter/cooling rack. This is why I recommend a chiffon cake pan, but if you are really 
            determined, you can make it work with a regular pan and some improvising (disclaimer: I have not tested this myself).
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the cake is totally cool, you can remove it from the pan. Again, this is so much easier with the proper chiffon cake pan.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        For frosting, I recommend a fluffy merengue or whipped cream frosting, shortcake style. Yuzu pairs well with kiwi or strawberry, so consider using 
        fresh fruit with your cake. If you want a buttercream, try adding poppyseed to balance the sweetness and acidity of the cake.

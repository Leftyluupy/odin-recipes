    <p>A recipe for chai masala to add to tea!</p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>16g black pepper</li>
        <li>25g ginger (dry)</li>
        <li>10g cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>20g cardomom pods</li>
        <li>1g clove</li>
        <li>1g nutmeg</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Procedure:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove outer shell from cardomom (this step is optional).</li>
        <li>Grind all ingredients in a spice mill.</li>
        <li>Store in airtight container and use as soon as possible, within 3-6 months.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To prepare some tea with the masala, gather the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A pot (preferably with a pour spout)</li>
        <li>A tea strainer or fine sieve</li>
        <li>1 cup of water</li>
        <li>1 cup of milk</li>
        <li>2-4 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp tea leaves (use a cheaper and stronger tea)</li>
        <li>1/4 to 1/2 tsp of your chai masala</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Brew your tea:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add water, milk, and your chai masala to the pot. Heat the pot over medium or medium high heat (stirring occasionally), until small bubbles form on the surface and it seems very close to boiling.</li>
        <li>Add tea leaves and half of the sugar. Continue heating until boiling.</li>
        <li>As soon as the tea comes to a boil, reduce the heat until it is simmering. Simmer for 2 or 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Use a spoon and taste it a little bit. Careful not to scoop any tea leaves!</li>
        <li>If you want to add more sugar, this is the time. Otherwise, turn off the heat and carefully pour your tea through your strainer/seive into a big mug.</li>
        <li>Enjoy! Each time you brew, adjust the amounts of each ingredient until you find your favorite way to have chai.</li>
    </ol>
